在大二时进入本院数据安全联合实验室进行科研，跟进项目《面向实用数据库的Enclave存储引擎》，随着大数据时代的到来，隐私保护变的愈加重要，所以在云端实现真正的加密存储是重中之重，在此项研究中阅读大量文献了解可搜索加密、SGX与密态数据计算等相关的概念，并复现论文中的B+树存储结构，模拟存储引擎的缓冲区管理与磁盘数据存储管理接口，将enclage封装成udf，我相信不久的将来人工智能领域也需要进行隐私的保护。

In my sophomore year, I entered the data security joint laboratory of our college for research and followed up on the project "Enclave Storage Engine for Practical Databases". With the advent of the big data era, privacy protection has become increasingly important, so achieving true encrypted storage in the cloud is of utmost importance. In this study, I have read a large amount of literature to understand concepts related to searchable encryption, SGX, and secure data computing. And reproduce the B+tree storage structure in the paper, simulate the buffer management and disk data storage management interfaces of the storage engine, and encapsulate the enclave as a UDF. I believe that privacy protection will also be needed in the field of artificial intelligence in the near future.

我自身最感兴趣的领域应该是机器人了，在大一时我是偏向硬件的微电子专业，但在升大二时十分热衷于算法但又不喜欢传统的软件设计，所以转到了信息安全专业，学到了许多密码学以及网络攻防的知识。但由于ChatGPT的出现和其的强大，我意识到在未来，软件时代即将告终，即使是我学的安全专业也不例外，也使我意识到只有将软件和硬件相结合才是我或者是我们人类真正应该和擅长做的事情，并且我的代码能力很强，能更快的实现相关应用到实体的操作。所以在研究生阶段我更偏向研究一些与机器人相关的领域，真正的能有所成就。

My favorite field of interest is probably robotics. In my freshman year, I focused on hardware microelectronics, but in my sophomore year, I was very passionate about algorithms but didn't like traditional software design. Therefore, I switched to information security and learned a lot about cryptography and network attack and defense. But due to the emergence and power of ChatGPT, I realized that in the future, the software era is coming to an end, even my security major is no exception. It also made me realize that only combining software and hardware is what I or we humans should truly be good at, and my coding ability is strong, which can quickly implement related applications to physical operations. So in my future graduate studies, I tend to focus more on researching fields related to robotics, in order to truly achieve success.

It made me recognize that combining software and hardware is what I and humans should excel at. I possess strong coding skills that enable me to quickly implement related applications for physical operations.

Therefore, in my future graduate studies, I intend to focus more on researching fields related to robotics to achieve true success. Robotics research requires a diverse skill set, including knowledge of computer science, electronics, and mechanical engineering. I believe that my interdisciplinary background and passion for robotics would enable me to make significant contributions to the field.
